Low Level Interface (LLI)
=========================

The LLI consists of a AVR microcontroller in the form of an easy available
Arduino type board.

Use 'make' to compile and 'make install' to upload it onto the AVR. Use 'make test' to compile a helloworld example that just blinks with a led. (Not implemented yet)

You can also generate Doxygen documentaiton with 'make doc'.

Some other random notes
-----------------------
Compile a source file:
avr-gcc main.c -I. -g -DF_CPU=16000000 -mmcu=atmega328p -Os -o blink.elf

Make the hex file to be uploaded:
avr-objcopy -O ihex -R .eeprom blink.elf blink.hex

Program (upload) with the optiboot bootloader installed:
avrdude -p m328p -P /dev/ttyACM0 -c arduino -b 115200 -U flash:w:blink.hex

Program (upload) with the ISP:
avrdude -p m328p -c usbasp -U flash:w:blink.hex
